          <h3>We’re people-savvy technologists</h3>
          <p>
            Successful technology solutions start with giving people a voice and sense of ownership in the initiative. At Loginsoft, we solicit input early and often to keep the end user top of mind when matching technology and solutions to the user community. Because we know that user involvement results in faster adoption, lower training time, and happier users. After all, what’s the point of great technology if people struggle using it? We are proud that our solutions have high implementation success. And, as much as we like shiny, new, cutting-edge technology, we know that sometimes “low-tech” is the right choice. We’re not afraid to suggest a simple solution when it’s the most cost-effective and wisest option.
